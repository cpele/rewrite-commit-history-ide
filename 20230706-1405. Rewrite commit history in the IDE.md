- But rebasing also lets you do useful things like editing commits, removing them, squashing them, fixing them up...

## Words

- Git words
    - "Git" menu

- IDEA words
    - "VCS" menu

    - Update project, commit, push
- IDEA lets you use both
    - Try it!
    - Hit Shift key twice...
    - Then type `git merge`, `git fetch`...
    - Or type "update project"

- Lets you rebase if you want
- Keeps remote branch relatively safe
- Makes it hard rewriting *remote* history
